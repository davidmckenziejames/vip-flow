                  in your DJFAN account is your Creator Earnings at the relevant
                  time. All Fan Payments and Creator Earnings are transacted
                  most of the time in your local currency. If you have chosen

                  may charge you currency conversion or transfer fees to receive
                  the money. Additionally, your e-wallet company may charge you
                  a fee for accessing the money. We do not have control over
                  currency exchange rates or charges imposed by your bank or

                      do so. For the avoidance of doubt, it is your obligation
                      to comply with all provisions of VAT legislation and make,

                      If you are a Creator in the UK who is not required to
                      register for UK VAT, then you should monitor the level of
                      taxable sales that you make in the UK (including any
                      Referral Payments) to ensure you have not exceeded the VAT
                      registration threshold in the UK. It is your obligation,
                      as a taxable person, to monitor whether you have exceeded
                      the VAT registration threshold.

                      We do not monitor earnings that Creators receive from
                      other income sources. However, we will monitor the annual
                      earnings of UK Creators on our platform, and if you are
                      not already VAT registered and your earnings exceed the
                      VAT registration threshold, you will receive a
                      notification from us asking you to register for VAT. If
                      you receive such a VAT registration notification, you
                      agree to register for VAT as soon as possible and to send
                      your VAT registration number to us at{" "}

            What is the DJFAN Referral Program? DJFAN offers a referral program
            by which existing Users can introduce people who are interested in
            becoming Creators to DJFAN and receive referral payments from DJFAN
            which are calculated and limited as described in these Referral
            Program Terms.
            <br />
            The DJFAN Referral Program is operated by DJFAN Limited. We are a
            limited company registered in England, with company registration
            number 10354575 and we have our registered office address at Suite
            G04, 1 Quality Court, Chancery Lane, London, WC2A 1HR.

              The rules of the DJFAN Referral Program:
              <UnorderedList>
                <ListItem>
                  Only Users of DJFAN with a current User account can
                  participate in the DJFAN Referral Program. If a User&rsquo;s
                  account has been suspended or terminated by us for any reason
                  or deleted by the User, that User will not be eligible to
                  participate in the DJFAN Referral Program.
                </ListItem>
                <ListItem>
                  You will need on your User account page to add a bank account
                  or a payment method details of your bank account or a payment
                  method in order to receive referral payments under the DJFAN
                  Referral Program.
                </ListItem>
                <ListItem>
                  Each User has a unique referral link (which can be accessed
                  via the User&rsquo;s User account) which the User may share
                  with others. When sharing your unique referral link you must
                  not impersonate DJFAN or give the impression that your
                  referral link is being shared or promoted by us. You must not
                  use Google Ads or any similar advertising platform or search
                  engine advertising service to share or promote your unique
                  referral link. Upon our request, you must disclose the methods
                  by which you share your unique referral link in the
                  Bio/Website field of your DJFAN account.
                </ListItem>
                <ListItem>
                  The Referred Creator must click on your unique referral link
                  and then register with DJFAN using the same browser that they
                  used to click on your unique referral link. If someone
                  registers with DJFAN other than by using your unique referral
                  link, we will not link that account to your referral and no
                  referral payments will be made to you.
                </ListItem>
                <ListItem>
                  The Referred Creator must not have opened a User account with
                  DJFAN (whether under the same name or another name) before
                  clicking on your unique referral link. If the Referred Creator
                  is currently or has previously been a User of DJFAN no
                  referral payments will be made to you for the referral.

                  If the Referred Creator sets up more than one User account
                  referral payments will be made to you on the earnings made by
                  the Referred Creator from their first User account only. No
                  referral payments will be made to you on any further User
                  accounts set up by the Referred Creator.

                  No referral payments will be made to you on any referral of a
                  Referred Creator which we determine is owned or operated by
                  you, or is in a commercial relationship with you. You will
                  provide any information which we request to enable us to
                  determine whether the Referred Creator is owned or operated by
                  you or if there is a commercial relationship between you and
                  the Referred Creator.
