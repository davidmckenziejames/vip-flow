            Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
            third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or
            Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive
            certain profile information about you from your social media
            provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on
            the social media provider concerned, but will often include your
            name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as
            other information you choose to make public on such a social media
            platform.

            control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal

            that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect,

            necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
            longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
            tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this

            than the period of time in which users have an account with us.

          <p>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
            personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such
            information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
            personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
            will securely store your personal information and isolate it from

            We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
            organisational security measures designed to protect the security of
            any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards
            and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
            over the Internet or information storage technology can be
            guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that
            hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will
            not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access,
            steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
            protect your personal information, transmission of personal
            information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should
            only access the Services within a secure environment.

            least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and
            consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn
            that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has
            been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
            measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you
            become aware of any data we may have collected from children under
            age 18, please contact us at&nbsp;support@djfan.app.

            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
            determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
            in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
            provide information so that we can match it with information you
            have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of
            request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
            that we can match the information you provide with the information
            we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
            communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously
            provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the
            circumstances dictate.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will only use personal information provided in your request to
            verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent
            possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you
            for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your
            identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
            request that you provide additional information for the purposes of
            verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention
            purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as
            soon as we finish verifying you.
